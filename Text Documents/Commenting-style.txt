This doc contains a list of tips regarding comment formating choices/styles which are being used in Hatchetflash's development.
You technically don't *have* to follow these but probably do:
=-= =-= =-= =-= =-= =-= =-=       =-= =-= =-= =-= =-= =-= =-=       =-= =-= =-= =-= =-= =-= =-= 
















{ARCHAIC TEXT:}

==> Most (if not all) code files should have a multi-line file description at the start of the file like this:

/* (Name) file descripton:
* A comment talking about the file.
* A comment about to refer to multiple things:
* - List item #1;
* - List item #2;
* - and List item #3.
* Regular comments can also be included after lists, (the order of things in the description is not very limited.)
*/

{first line of code}
{second line of code}


=-= =-= =-= =-= =-= =-= =-=       =-= =-= =-= =-= =-= =-= =-=       =-= =-= =-= =-= =-= =-= =-= 


==> If you want to say what a part of the code (1 or multuple lines) does, put a comment such as this on the line before all of the applicable:

{not applicable code}

{not applicable code}
// Comment that begins with a capital letter at the start, and ends with proper punctuation.
{applicable code for only #1}
{applicable code for only #1}
// A second comment that begins with a capital letter at the start, and ends with proper punctuation.
{applicable code for only #2}
{applicable code for only #2}

{not applicable code}


=-= =-= =-= =-= =-= =-= =-=       =-= =-= =-= =-= =-= =-= =-=       =-= =-= =-= =-= =-= =-= =-= 


==> If you want to specify the inputs of a function or make a small note about a particular line of code, put a comment after the code like this:

{not applicable code}
{applicable code} //A comment that starts with a capital letter but not a space, and ends with proper punctuation.
{not applicable code}

{not applicable code}


=-= =-= =-= =-= =-= =-= =-=       =-= =-= =-= =-= =-= =-= =-=       =-= =-= =-= =-= =-= =-= =-= 


==> If you want to explain the functions of a particular function, class or contained very large swath of code, use a multi-line comment similar to file description ones:

{not applicable code}

{not applicable code}
/* Explain quickly what is being described:
* A comment talking about the code
* A comment about to refer to multiple things:
* - List item #1;
* - List item #2;
* - and List item #3.
* Regular comments can also be included after lists, (the order of things in the description is not very limited.)

==> If you want to make a very imperinant comment about anything, write it in all caps like this:

// This comment is probably going to stay mostly the same in the code for a while.
// THIS COMMENT RELATES TO SOMETHING THAT'S ACTIVELY BEING DEVELOPED/WORKED ON AND WON'T EXIST FOR VERY LONG.
