=-= =-= =-= =-= =-= =-= =-=

* #include -ing <cmath> in "Main.cpp", although not directly because of linux, was added due to Fox's IDE not adding this automatically.
* (glfw.a is used for linux compiling of the project.)
* Added a build script to the availible files for aid with linux compiling. (Otherwise, shaderClass may not load correctly.)
