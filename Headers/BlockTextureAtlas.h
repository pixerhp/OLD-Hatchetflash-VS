/*   BlockTextureAtlas.h file description:
* Note that the block texture class is a singleton class, meaning that there is only ever one BlockTextureAtlas object in memory.
* A texture atlas is a large texture composed of a bunch of smaller textures, such as a grid of block textures in this case.
* Many of the functions are defined in "BlockTextureAtlas.cpp".
