A list of IDs used for the shape of blocks;

0-162 - Reserved for all of the combinations of block shapes formed when you remove 0-4 vertices from a cube's vertices. //163 = sum of nCr(2^3,n) for n = 0,1,2,3 and 4.
163-1140 - Reserved for all of the combinations created by squishing the 163 shapes into each of the 6 directions, such that for example a cube might become a slab. //(163 to 163 + 163*6)
[later numbers] - used for common future unrelated or more manually defined shapes.
[the largest possible number in the ID] - Reserved to indicate a custom model, the next information after this ID should always be/allow for a path to the model in some way.
